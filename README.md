# Data-Analyst-journey

My journey toward becoming a Data Analyst began in 2023. Although I had to pause in between to focus on personal commitments, I did complete the Azure Fundamentals course during this time.

I have created a personal blog that showcases the technical and management skills I’ve gained over the years. With five years of experience as a successful Project Manager in India, I had the opportunity to explore my abilities and handle diverse situations with resilience.

I moved to the UK in June 2021, and while the experience has enriched me personally and professionally, I haven’t yet had the chance to return to a Project Manager role. I am currently working at Circet Ireland & UK—initially joining as a Design Manager, and now contributing as a Project Coordinator across various telecom projects.

Over the past four years in the UK, I’ve gained a solid understanding of the job market. During my time at Circet, I also attended multiple training sessions, including Agile Project Management, AWS Cloud, and Data Analysis. Through these experiences, my passion for Data Analysis grew, although I had not fully pursued it at the time due to other priorities.

I have now created a blog dedicated to my Data Analysis journey, showcasing my skills and the projects I’ve completed. Please click here to view it.
